# GC Content Calculator

This is a simple Python program that computes the **GC content** of a DNA sequence.  
GC content is the percentage of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that are either **Guanine (G)** or **Cytosine (C)**.

---

## Features

- Reads a DNA sequence assigned to a variable in the script
- Counts the number of G and C nucleotides
- Computes the total GC content as a percentage
- Outputs the GC content with two decimal points

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `gc.py`.
3. Make the file executable (if using UNIX/Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod a+x gc.py
Or, alternatively:

```bash
python3 gc.py
```
Example Output
```bash
GC content: 53.06%
```
Notes

The DNA sequence is currently hardcoded in the script.

You can modify the dna variable in the script to test other sequences.

The program is written in Python 3.
