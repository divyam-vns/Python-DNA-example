# Demonstrate use of pass.
motif = "ATG"
dna = "GGGATGCCC"

if motif not in dna:
    pass  # placeholder, code will be inserted later
else:
    print("Motif found!")

# output- 
# Motif found!


# pass statement is a placeholder, it does nothing. it is used when a statement required syntactically but you don't want any command or code to execute. 
# sometimes you can use the pass statement also when you didn’t yet write the codefor a particular situation but you need the placeholder so thjat the syntax of the rest of your program is correct.
